   <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

   <p>
      Please read these Terms of Use (<b>"Terms"</b>) carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to)
      Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software
      applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the <b>"Spotify Service"</b>) and any music,
      videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service
      (<b>"Content"</b>).
   </p>

   <p>
      Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the <a href="#">Spotify Privacy Policy</a> and additional terms and
      conditions presented
      by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.
   </p>

   <h2>2. The Spotify Service</h2>
   <h3>Spotify Service options</h3>

   <p>
      We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while
      other options require payment before they can be accessed (<b>"Paid Subscriptions"</b>). We may also offer special
      promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and
      services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.
   </p>

   <h3>Trials</h3>
   <p>
      From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period
      without payment or at a reduced rate (<b>"Trial"</b>). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the
      Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.
   </p>

   <h2>3. Your Use of the Spotify Service</h2>
   <h3>Creating a Spotify account</h3>

   <p>
      You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and password are
      for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You understand that you are responsible for all use
      (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our Customer Service team immediately if
      your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account.
   </p>

   <p>Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.</p>

   <h3>Your rights to use the Spotify Service</h3>
   <h4>Access to the Spotify Service</h4>

   <p>
      Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we grant to you
      limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Spotify Service and the
      Content (collectively, <b>"Access"</b>). This Access shall remain in effect unless and until terminated by you or
      Spotify. You agree that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.
   </p>

   <h2>4. Content and Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
   <h3>User Content</h3>
   <h4>The content you post on the Spotify Service</h4>

   <p>
      Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Spotify Service (<b>"User Content"</b>).
      For the avoidance of doubt, User Content includes all information, materials and other content that is added,
      created, uploaded, submitted, distributed, or posted to the Spotify Service (including to the Spotify Support
      Community) by users.
   </p>

   <p>
      You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.
   </p>

   <p>
      You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such
      User Content; and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify pursuant to the license granted below, does not:
      (i) violate these Terms, including the Spotify User Guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property or
      other rights of any third party; or (ii) imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by
      Spotify or any artist, band, label, or other individual or entity without the prior express written consent from
      Spotify or such individual or entity.
   </p>

   <h2>5. Customer Support, Information, Questions, and Complaints</h2>
   <h3>Spotify support community</h3>

   <p>
      Spotify Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the
      Spotify Service. By using Spotify Community, you agree to the Community Terms.
   </p>

   <h3>Customer support, information, questions, and complaints</h3>

   <p>
      For customer support with account- and payment-related questions (<b>"Customer Support Queries"</b>), please use
      Customer Support resources listed on the About Us section of our website.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms
      and conditions incorporated herein), please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of
      our website. You may also contact us at the mailing address set forth in the "Service Provider" section at the
      start of these Terms.
   </p>

   <h2>6. Problems and Disputes</h2>
   <h3>Suspending and terminating the Spotify Service</h3>

   <p>
      These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify. Spotify may terminate these
      Terms (including any additional terms and conditions incorporated herein) or suspend your access to the Spotify
      Service at any time if we believe you have breached any of these Terms, if we stop providing the Spotify Service
      or any material component thereof, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law. If you or Spotify
      terminate these Terms, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall
      have no liability or responsibility to you, and (except as expressly provided in these Terms) Spotify will not
      refund any amounts that you have already paid. You may terminate these Terms at any time, in which case you may
      not continue accessing or using the Spotify Service. To learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please use
      the Customer Support resources on our About Us page.
   </p>

   <p>
      The following sections shall survive termination: Sections 2 (The Spotify Service), 3 (Your Use of the Spotify
      Service) (except as set forth therein), 4 (Content and Intellectual Property Rights), 6 (Problems and Disputes), 7
      (About These Terms), as well as any other sections of these Terms that, either explicitly or by their nature, must
      remain in effect even after termination of these Terms.
   </p>

   <h2>7. About These Terms</h2>

   <p>
      Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These Terms are in no way
      intended to restrict those rights.
   </p>

   <h3>Changes</h3>

   <p>
      We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by
      reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting
      the revised Terms on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to
      supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Spotify
      Service, or other means). Your use of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute
      your acceptance of such changes. Premium Subscribers who do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under
      the updated Terms must close their Spotify account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the
      Effective Date, whichever occurs first. If Spotify makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other
      than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written
      notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to tounotice@spotify.com. This opt-out notice must
      be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email
      address associated with your Spotify account, phone number, and Spotify username. Such an opt-out must be sent by
      you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act
      on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the
      Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of
      arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Spotify
      agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the
      Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such opt-out.
   </p>

   <h3>Entire agreement</h3>

   <p>
      Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, these Terms
      constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in
      relation to the subject matter of these Terms, whether written or oral. As noted above, other terms and conditions
      governing use of the Spotify Service are incorporated herein by reference, including the following terms and
      conditions: Spotify Paid Subscription Terms; Spotify Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions; Spotify's Card
      Terms; Spotify User Guidelines; Spotify Copyright Policy; and Spotify Support Community Terms.
